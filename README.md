# Insights
- This analysis helps to identify which tweets had the most engagement. Analyzing these tweets will help to understand what the audience finds most engaging, which will help improve future content.
- Many users are more likely to “Like” a tweet than to reply or retweet it. This suggests that even if users are interacting with the content, they are not encouraged to reply or retweet the content. This indicates that more shareable content needs to be created in the future.
- According to the positive correlation between impressions and engagements, the tweets that are viewed many times are most likely to get more interactions. This suggests that the visibility of the content needs to be increased.
- There is a significant increase in engagement rate from December 2020 to February 2021 which indicates that the strategies used at that time were successfully able to increase the engagements. However, the subsequent drop in the graph suggests that the strategies used in later months adversely affect the engagement rate.

# Conclusion

According to the data, there is need to create more shareable and discussion-provoking content to increase more replies and retweets of the posts. The visibility of the tweets needs to be increased in order to increase the engagement. Also, the strategies used in February 2021 needs to be re-instantiated in coming future to increase the engagement rate.
